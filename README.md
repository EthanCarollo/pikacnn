**Data folder**, it's here where you put the dataset folder with every labels, in, you can also apply data augmentations that are in the jupyter folder.

### Gleam

**Gleam Folder**, a little example of how we can make a little CNN with Tensorflow JS and Gleam, nothing really solid but it works !

## Datasets 

We can use a large amount of dataset, in our case, we use :
